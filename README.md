# Methods Manuscript

This repository contains the code to analyze the data and create the plots for the manuscript, "[Title of manuscript]". [May want to add info about how this code can be reused and / or a license / copyright info.]

Note: The .fcs files are too large to push to Github. [Add if they can be obtained from the authors by email, or if there is another way to get them. Will we submit the data to another data repository after publication, for example?]
