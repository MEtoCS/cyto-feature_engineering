# Methods Manuscript

This repository contains the code to analyze the data and create the plots for the manuscript, "Cyto-Feature Engineering: A Pipeline for Flow Cytometry Analysis to Uncover Immune Populations and Association with Disease". [May want to add info about how this code can be reused and / or a license / copyright info.]

Note: The .fcs files are too large to push to Github. The data can be obtained from Amy Fox (amyfox@colostat.edu). The data will also be submitted to ImmPort after publication.
